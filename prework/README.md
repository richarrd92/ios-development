## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps and Features

- Introduce a feature to post pictures that can only be viewed by selected individuals for enhanced privacy.

YouTube

## App Idea: Structured Gym Timer for iOS
I often find the existing gym timer apps on iOS either cluttered or lacking the structure needed for an efficient workout. My idea is to create a well-designed gym timer app tailored for fitness enthusiasts who value organization and ease of use. Key features would include:

- Customizable Workouts: Allow users to create, save, and organize workout routines, including warm-ups, active sets, and rest intervals.
- Visual Cues and Sounds: Provide visual and auditory signals for transitions between exercises, rest periods, and workout completion.
- Progress Tracking: Include a feature to track workout history and progress over time, integrating with Apple Health.
- Community Features: Option to share routines with friends or download routines from popular fitness influencers.
  
This app would combine aesthetics and functionality, addressing the gap in the market for a structured, user-friendly gym timer.

## Notes

- The instructions were pretty much straight forward, as a result i had no issues while building the app
