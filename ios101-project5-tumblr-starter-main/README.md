# Project 5 - News Feed app

Submitted by: **Richard Maliyetu**

**News Feed app** is an iOS app that keeps users informed with the latest news articles from various sources. The app fetches articles dynamically from a public news API, displaying article titles, descriptions, images. Users can browse through a feed of the most recent news stories. Unlike previous projects where data was hardcoded, the News Feed app fetches articles in real-time, offering a more dynamic and varied news experience.
